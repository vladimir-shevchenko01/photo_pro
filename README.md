# PHOTOGRAPHER PROFILE

This is a portfolio site for my dear friend and talented photographer. This is my first project when I started learning programming, so please don't judge me harshly.

There is a slider on the main page showing the most interesting works, from where you can go to the gallery section containing photo shoots by category. You can familiarize yourself with each category separately. In addition, the "About me" and "Contacts" pages are available.
